            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Daniel Bonifaz-Calvo Ibarrola, I’m a professional engineer born and raised in Mexico City, holding dual degrees in Computer Engineering and Industrial Systems. I have developed a dynamic, adaptable skill set that transcends industry boundaries.

            <p>
                My passions and expertise include software development in Python, R, SQL, and data analysis, as well as experimental design using Minitab. Beyond analytics, I have the ability to design 3D objects using tools like SketchUp, Tinkercad, Fusion 360, and Inventor, seamlessly blending technical precision with innovative thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have extensive leadership experience, having successfully guided teams of 30 to 50 employees toward their goals. My leadership style emphasizes clear communication, strategic planning, and a commitment to continuous improvement—qualities essential for thriving in fast-paced, ever-changing environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Above all, I truly enjoy continuously learning and embracing new professional challenges, finding inspiration in fresh methodologies, cutting-edge technologies, and evolving work experiences that keep me innovating at every turn. Ultimately, my driving force is the pursuit of excellence, a passion that inspires me to learn, adapt, and consistently deliver outstanding results that leave a positive, lasting impact.
